Making collectibles
Use.... collision and maybe something like if the spaceship x and y is the same as the coordinates of the collectible
then use a variable to count the scores and point scores either in terminal or the screen.

The collectible can be some sort of coin or space related, maybe satellite (effort but worth it?)
Game doesnt have to end sooooooooo B) nothing needed to make the game end, just infinite loop of collecting stuff and whatever idk maaan i need sleeeeeep
